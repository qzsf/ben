Practical Ranges (Neural Networks)
Tabular Data (MLP)
Typical recommendation:
Samples	Expected Behavior
< 500	Very unstable
500–2000	Risky
2k–10k	Usable
10k+	Good
50k+	Comfortable


We typically use MAE to evaluate the performance of a regression model. However, it is not always straightforward to assess how accurate the model is, especially when comparing models trained on different sample sizes, such as 300 versus 500 samples.
